 Phaser: Keyboard events

Published in 2021

    This post is part of a Phaser series. Click here to see the first post of the series.

Mouse events are fired on a GameObject, because with the mouse we click on elements.

With the keyboard instead we press keys, not linked to any GameObject in particular.

So we listen for those events on this.input.keyboard, like this:

this.input.keyboard.on(<event>, function() {

})

<event> is a string that can be keyup or keydown, to intercept all keys pressed, or a combination of it with a letter identifying a specific key, like:

    keyup-A
    keyup-THREE
    keydown-F12
    keydown-ENTER

We have a large number of identifiers we can use, including:

    A ~ Z
    F1 ~ F12
    BACKSPACE
    TAB
    ENTER
    SHIFT
    CTRL. ALT
    PAUSE
    CAPS_LOCK
    ESC
    SPACE
    PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN
    END, HOME
    LEFT, UP, RIGHT,DOWN
    PRINT_SCREEN
    INSERT, DELETE
    ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE
    NUMPAD_ZERO, NUMPAD_ONE, NUMPAD_TWO, NUMPAD_THREE, NUMPAD_FOUR, NUMPAD_FIVE, NUMPAD_SIX, NUMPAD_SEVEN, NUMPAD_EIGHT, NUMPAD_NINE, NUMPAD_ADD, NUMPAD_SUBTRACT

Instead of listenining on individual keys, we can get an object calling this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys():

let cursors

function create() {
  cursors = this.input.keyboard.createCursorKeys()
}

and in the update() function, we can check if one specific key has been pressed, and do something when this happens:

function update() {
  if (cursors.right.isDown) {
    text.x += 5
  }
  if (cursors.left.isDown) {
    text.x -= 5
  }
  if (cursors.up.isDown) {
    text.y -= 5
  }
  if (cursors.down.isDown) {
    text.y -= 5
  }
}
