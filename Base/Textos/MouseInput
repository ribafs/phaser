Any GameObject can be made interactive.

To do so, we must call the setInteractive() method on it:

text = this.add.text(100, 100, 'test')
text.setInteractive()

Once a GameObject is interactive, it can listen for events.

This is done using the on() method. We pass an event name, and a callback function that’s executed when the event occurs:

text.on('pointerup', function () {})

pointerup is just one of the mouse events we can listen for. We also have:

    pointerdown
    pointerdownoutside
    pointerup
    pointerupoutside
    pointermove
    pointerover
    pointerout
    wheel

This is just the beginning. We have many advanced mouse (and touch events) controls at our disposal.

gameobjectdown is a more general event that is fired when any interactive element is clicked, and it’s not fired on an object, but on this.input:

this.input.on('gameobjectdown', () => {})

this.button = this.add.sprite(xy.x, xy.y - 96, 'start').setInteractive();
this.button.on('pointerover', function(){this.button.setTint(0xf0ff00);}, this)
this.button.on('pointerout', function(){this.button.setTint(0xffffff);}, this)
this.button.on('pointerdown', function(){
  //do things on click
});

// This line calls the function associated with the button's 'pointerdown' event
this.button.emit('pointerdown');
