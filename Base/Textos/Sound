Similar to displaying images, Before you can play an audio file, you must preload it and assign it to a label:

function preload() {
  this.load.audio('sound', 'sound.mp3')
}

For images we used this.load.image(), here we use this.load.audio().

Once this is done, we can use the sound into our create() or update() functions:

this.sound.add('sound')

This will get you back an object. It’s important to assign it to a variable:

const sound = this.sound.add('sound')

Because later, when we want, we’ll call the play() method on it:

sound.play()

You can combine this with mouse events, for example, to play a sound when an item is clicked or hovered.
